      I am a full stack web developer and tech enthusiast with interests in machine learning and cloud
computing. I have had to learn java spring-boot framework that is entirely used in most enterprise backend API building.I am currently learning React library in building reusable components for front-end
development. I have associate level skills in cloud computing(Google Cloud Associate) in deploying apps
in the App engine and Kubernetes(GKE service) for scalability. I also have intermediate experience in
data persistence in Google Cloud Storage service.
I have also had the opportunity of building machine learning models and also using Pythonâ€™s libraries in
Sklearn to build effective models on data provided by clients.
